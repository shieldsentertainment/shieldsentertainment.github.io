            <h2>About</h2>
            <p><img src="images/james-shields.jpg" alt="James Shields" class="photo-left" />Having worked professionally as a DJ for over ten years, James Shields formed <strong>Shields Entertainment</strong> in 2013 in order to build on his
            experience working in the entertainment business and provide high-end entertainment services under his own brand. Born and raised in
            Edinburgh, James started DJing in 2000 and has since become one of the leading DJs and entertainment providers in the Edinburgh, Lothians and Fife
            areas.</p>
            <p>James cut his teeth in the entertainment business back in the days when he carried crates of CDs from venue to venue. Since then, he has
            done everything from mobile DJing in pubs and clubs, to hosting karaoke nights and resident DJ spots in various venues in the Edinburgh area.
            </p>
            <p>Of course these days, technology has changed (for starters - the crates of CDs have been replaced with laptops) and so have the demands and expectations
            of our clients. James formed <strong>Shields Entertainment</strong> in response to this shift in expectations - having listened to what customers want from an entertainment
            service, <strong>Shields Entertainment</strong> offers bespoke services that meet the needs of your event. Whether you're planning a disco, karaoke, race night, fundraiser
            or any other event, <strong>Shields Entertainment</strong> can provide you a one-stop-shop solution for all your entertainment needs.</p>
            
            <p>Since 2016, James has been volunteering as an audio commentator for the visually impaired Hearts fans at Tynecastle Park and is used as relief stadium announcer from
            time to time. As of November 2018, James will be official matchday stadium announcer for <a href="https://www.hamiltonacciesfc.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hamilton Academical FC</a>.</p>

                Thank you so much, you came highly recommended and we weren't disappointed!

                Came across Shields entertainment on the internet and booked for my mums 50th last weekend -
                amazing reviews but was slightly worried as the age for my event was from 18 - 80, but honestly the music was fab -
                everyone up dancing and he played all the requests not a problem. Would recommend to anyone,
                and any parties in the future I know who I will book - thank you for such a great night!

                Just a big thanks to <strong>Shields Entertainment</strong> for making our birthday surprise a big one. We had our party in April
                at the Wash Bar in Edinburgh, and Jim was our DJ for the evening. Jim is lovely, and a very nice person as
                an individual - he is calm and has a great personality. It was a small function (just as we wanted) and he
                ran it very well - in fact, his music was such a killer that after the function, we carried on to a club
                afterwards to carry on the party!<br />
                James and Jim - big thanks and be assured of repeat custom from me and my people!

                We booked <strong>Shields Entertainment</strong> for my sisters 50th birthday party in September 2013. We were more than happy with selection of music used over the evening.
                James was very happy to source and play a particular list of music I requested across the course of the evening, and he managed the timings of the buffet and speeches professionally and in a very friendly manner, with enthusiasm and wit.
                I would certainly use again in the future for similar events.

                Booked for a surprise 30th. James was our DJ and we could not be happier with the
                services. From start to finish he played such amazing music, He seemed to just know the
                music we all loved. Great banter and kept me right all night. Cannot recommend enough
                and I am so glad he was recommended to me :) <br />
                Thanks so much again!

                I used <strong>Shields Entertainment</strong> for my 21st and can not thank him enough. Created such a
                good atmosphere and knew exactly what songs to play and when which kept the dance
                floor busy all night. Was more than happy to take request but hardly any were needed
                cause he played such great songs. Thanks so much again know where to go next time I
                need a DJ!!!
